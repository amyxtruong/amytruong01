        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Amy Huynh Truong and I am currently a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. Being a first generation student and an only child in my household, I had to figure out the process of entering college on my own. I initially started college as a biochemistry major, however I found that my true passion was in psychology. AP Psychology was extremely interesting to me during my senior year of highschool. It‚Äôs just something about learning how the brain works that intrigues me. With my psychology degree, I hope to be able to become either a physician‚Äôs assistant or a therapist one day. Working in the medical field has been a lifelong dream of mine. For as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to work in the medical field and be a part of the exhilarating rush. All of the medical dramas that I watched growing up captured my attention, prompting me to follow through with my desire to become a physician in the future. To pursue this goal, I joined the Fountain Val
        ley Regional Hospital volunteering program to have a possible role in changing the lives of others, who are unable to help themselves. As a college student and prospective P.A. student, I am looking forward to finding physician shadowing positions and additional hospital hours as a hands-on intern. Hopefully, after 5 or so years I hope to look back on this website and know that I accomplished my goals that I set for myself. Helping people is the ultimate goal but having a content and successful career is another on my list.  Even though they‚Äôre hard, I know I have the determination to fulfill this dream to ultimately live a great life in the future. <br><br>

        Aside from my future goals, I enjoy nice walks along
        the beach during the nighttime and trying out new foods. Contrary to popul
        ar belief, I am actually not very fond of the beach, especially the wet sand that gets stuck in between the toes. The sea breeze and the freshness of the ocean helps me relieve stress. Also, I hate tanning which is why I mentioned how I enjoyed walks during the nighttime. Growing up, I was exposed to all sorts of foods because my dad loved food himself. I have experienced foods from various cultures and all I can say is that I have an appreciation for all cultures. However, my all time favorites will always be shabu-shabu, sushi, and Vietnamese food. Besides eating food I also enjoy making different types of food that are new to me such as baking, exotic foods and etc. I love to bake and when I first baked I failed a ton, but after getting the hang of it I adore it as an art and do it most of the time.  In my free time, I am always either helping out my family, who just came from Vietnam, or going to concerts whenever/ financially possible. My favorite genre of music is EDM (also known as electronic dance music) because I get happy vibes when listening to it. The best concert that I attended has to be the Los Angeles Shrine show by Slander. Slander played one of my favorite songs called ‚ÄúYou Don‚Äôt Know Me,‚Äù while having great lasers and visuals.
